    <div id="bio">
        <p id="bio-text">Emma was born in 1992 in a cute little house in Vlijmen, the Netherlands. There is now a
            highway where the
            house used to be¬†*(fig.1)*.*fig.1 A59 Vlijmen*
            <br>
            Emma's dad runs a consultanty firm. He wears a suit to work and drives a BMW.Emma's mom used to be a flight
            attendant. She recently retired and now works as a yogateacher and a life coach.¬†
            <br>
            Emma was a shy but fast learning child and her proud parents were often trying to capture this with their
            Sony Video8 camera recorder¬†*(fig.2)*. Soon Emma started asking to please hold the camera, until finally one
            day they let her. From that moment on she started making talent shows, commercials and reality programs with
            her sisters and friends.*fig.2 Sony camera*
            <br>
            In highschool, Emma filmed and edited various music videos starring her classmates and teachers. She didn't
            really question why, she just liked to do it.
            <br>
            In 2011 Emma got accepted to Design Academy Eindhoven. It was the first time school was truly challenging
            for her. Somehow she thought everything she did had to be logical and make sense, which is not a great
            mindset when you are in art school.
            <br>
            In 2015 Emma found an internship at Extrapolation Factory, a speculative design duo in New York, and
            discovered the possibility of a non-commercial, fun and friendship-based design practice.
            <br>
            She came back to Eindhoven to make her graduation research about package deal vacations, which resulted in
            the VRcation project.
            <br>
            Shortly after, missing her days in the big apple, Emma decided to find the most New York like city in The
            Netherlands -which she thought to be Rotterdam- and moved there.
            <br>
            About a year after graduating from her BA, Emma decided to apply to the Non Linear Narrative masters program
            at KABK. There she learned a lot about research and technology, picked up some academic words like
            ‚Äògenealogy‚Äô and made lots of new work. She felt she was getting closer to what she wanted to do in life, and
            made good friends, and started to understand the (art)world a little better.
            <br>
            After graduating from NLN, Emma and her friends Ben, Gijs, Jack and Kirsten founded a space called¬†[Extra
            Practice](https://extrapractice.space/), because they missed working and learning together like they used to
            do together in art school. They still work and play almost every day in the tiny studio space on Zwaanshals
            in Rotterdam Noord.
            <br>
            Emma still does not really know what se wants to do in life, but is very much enjoying the journey. She
            enjoys teaching workshops here and there, forming new collaborations, organising events with Extra Practice,
            and developing her own autonomous research. What a life!
